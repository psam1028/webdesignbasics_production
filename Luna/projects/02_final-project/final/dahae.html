                    <h3>
                Dahae Song is waiting for me outside a high-rise complex in Soho. She has a cigarette in hand, and is gazing at people walking by. Something about the way she stands calmly, wearing black pants speckled with white paint, makes me think she’s older than 24-years-old. When she’s done introducing herself, she flicks her cigarette and we make our way to the roof of the apartment building where the Toronto based artist has been staying for her week-long vacation. Dahae’s work is mysterious in content and medium, as she layers paint and digital illustration to create complex and bold pieces that exude an unearthly feeling. Nonsense caught up with the artist to talk about her relationship with memory, digitally and mental health and how it is translated into her work.
 
</br>
</br>
<b>Can you tell me how you see digitally in this day in age and the way it blends into the physical world, like it does in your art?</b>
</br>
</br>
 When we were younger we had the distinction between something physical- like we went out and played on the playground but watching TV and going on the computer was a completely separate thing.  We are one of the last generations who have that distinction.  Like now, the kid that we saw in the elevator [holding a plastic phone], like anyone in the world- there’s no distinction between digital world and physical world. It’s so intermingled and connected that there’s no separation between the two things.  
</br>
</br>
 That’s why I layer digital and physical imagery and digital languages, because that’s the state of our existence-- as humans we cannot separate the two things anymore. Even our day-to-day life, our memory, how we think, how we live, it’s all intermingled.  I wouldn't call myself a digital person. The only thing I do online is social media- not even like Facebook. Just Instagram just to promote myself and such, but I have four computers but there’s nothing but softwares that I use to make my work on but I don’t use anything else. You don’t even have to go through my browsing history to figure out what I do, because I don’t do anything online.  
</br>
</br>
<b>Woah. So how does that change your perspective?</b>
</br>
</br>
For me it allows me to step back and observe it. Because I’m not- at least I would like to think that I’m not completely lost in it myself.
</br>
</br>
<b>That’s so fascinating. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone else like that?</b>
</br>
</br>
My friends think I’m so weird. I try to stay as far away from Internet and any form of media because I know how much shit would influence me and affect me, because I absorb so much, so I try to stay away from it.
</br>
</br>
<b>How has your background in psychology influenced you creatively?</b>
</br>
</br>
My relationship with art and psychology is inseparable. I use the act of creation as a processing mechanism for my experiences. My work is a physical manifestation of my emotional and psychological state- stages of disorder towards a state of order.  The reason psychology is so important to me is because I went through so much psychological issues. Depression, anxiety, things like that and art is the only reason I’m still alive and sane and functional. For me, my mental state and my art are directly related and interconnected.  This process is an act of reasserting control over myself through re-interpreting and re-asserting facts to give coherence to a fragmented state of mind.
</br>
</br>
<b>Your work surrounds a lot of ideas of construction and memory. What are your thoughts on how we remember and how that influences your art?</b>
</br>
</br>
I am an observer and an absorber. I believe that everything I encounter and experience gets stored in our subconscious, or what I like to call a mental morgue, a personal visual archive. These things are constructed in my head through a nonlinear process, not under perfect control, that co-produce/fabricate reality. My work is the visualization of the hybrid and layered forms of memory. In terms of the subject matter and medium I work with, I like to connect to the digitization of human experience and its impact on memory; the blurred sense of experience and identity between cyber life and physical reality in an expanding digital landscape- they are so interconnected and inseparable. I visually represent that state of human existence by unionizing tangible art objects with the digital, to create a hybrid form of art that synchronizes and equalizes the physical and virtual in its stages and states.
</br>
</br>
<b>Looking at your work gives me a very haunting feeling, which I think is really beautiful.</b>  
</br>
</br>I think that’s because for me, my work is very organic and I base it on my own psychological state.  And I have this really weird-- well, it’s like a coping mechanism. You know how you subconsciously block things out? For me that’s really really strong. So that’s probably what you get out of it. I have this huge blurred sense of reality.  For me, the way we make sense of art and the way we make sense of our experiences and memory are the same thing.  We take parts of our experiences and our lives and we fabricate things. Art is a fabrication of images. So is our memory.
</br>
</br>
<b>You think we ever remember memories the way they went or are they always distorted?</b>
</br>
</br>
They’re always distorted. It’s solipsism, a philosophical theory that things only exist in your mind, which is true. Everything is so subjective.  So memory, even though it’s your personal memory and you’re the one who experienced it, your brain will process it in a different way than how it actually happened.  Memory is never truth. At least for me it’s not-- and I know it’s not.
</br>
</br>
<b>Super subjective.</b>
</br>
</br>
So subjective. I know how to modify my own memory. I know how to go back in my past and delete certain parts, cut them apart, re-organize them.  So it’s like, for me a memory is not the actual story, it’s not the actual event.
</br>
</br>
<b>If everything is so subjective how do you make sense of anything.</b>
</br>
</br>
There’s no need to define everything. What grounds me is art, because I haven’t had art my entire life.  Out of highschool I wanted to go to art school, but my parents were against it. That’s why I went to University of Toronto  for psychology but it made me so depressed.  I was depressed for three years, I dropped out of University of Toronto and I ran away to Africa by myself, when I was 19 for a year.
</br>
</br>
<b>Where’d you go?</b>
</br>
</br>
Tanzania.  To find myself.  It didn’t happen; It made me more depressed.
</br>
</br>
<b>Why’d you chose Tanzania?</b>
</br>
</br>
Well I’ve always been interested in that kind of work,  in Humanitarian work. So because I was like Psychology is not working out for me. I was like, maybe I need something more hands on, so I tried it out. The only thing I learned there was, you can’t help someone until you help yourself. I got so tired of being so sad all the time.  
</br>
</br>
<b>Digital pieces exist in a different space and time than 2D pieces. How do you feel your pieces change with medium? How do you feel about the simultaneous permanence of your digital art and transience of digitality?</b>
</br>
</br>
 Spatio-temporality of my work is something I am very invested and aware of. Because I am addressing the very issue of the “simultaneous permanence and transience” of human experience and memory in a technologically mediated world in my work, I think it strengthens my work rather than de-value it. I always do create a single tactile art object of the digital, and they’re distinctly different and modified from the digital file. Experiencing and interacting with a tangible object or person is different from that of the digital. But both the experiences cannot be disregarded or put into a hierarchy.
</br>
</br>
<b>Yeah. So right now how do you see yourself progressing as an artist? Are you working on other mediums?</b>
</br>
</br>
I’m still a student, I’m graduating next year but I don’t see myself as a student because that’s not how other people see me.  Within the week, not even the week, like the four days of me being here, I got offered to do artist talks, I’m working with Mercedes Benz to do digital paintings, I did a live painting for the government to announce their new 2.5 million dollar creative fund incentive (which my works will be shown further at the summit). I don’t know what part of my life I’ll be in the next 6 months, I have no idea where i’m going to be.  I know I’ll be going forward, I just don’t know to what extent.
</br>
</br>
<b>And you’d like to move here? Manhattan?</b>
</br>
</br>
I just love the city. I don’t ever make plans. For me it’s like go with the flow. I don’t want to work towards one thing and then lose it because I’m so narrow minded towards one thing.  That’s the same with my art making. I always explore new mediums.  I will always be a painter, but I never see painting as the dead end.  I’m always just excited.</h3>
