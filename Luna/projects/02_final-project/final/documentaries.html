<b>1. Black Power Mixtape</b>
</br>
Using striking 16mm footage from Swedish journalists, The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 is one of the most unadulterated and important documentations of the Black Power Movement. Weaving together striking visual and audio archives, new interviews and soundtrack, the film illuminates the importance of the movement through an honest and fresh lens. Black Power Mixtape features candid commentary and interviews from leaders like Stokely Carmichael, Huey P. Newton and Angela Davis, along with commentary from contemporary black artists, activists, and scholars, speaking about their own relationship with the movement, as well as its profound impact.
</br>
</br>
<b>2. Trials of Muhammad Ali (Available on Instant Netflix and Hulu Plus)</b>
</br>
Trials of Muhammad Ali is a beautifully intense film that focuses on the boxer’s struggle against a 5-year prison sentence when he refused to serve in Vietnam. The film focuses on the years between 1967 and 1970, when, largely unknown to U.S. audiences, Ali was forced to live in exile within his own country because of his spiritual and moral beliefs. Trials of Muhammad Ali documents a passionate and dedicated fight for justice and causes one to think about collective erasure of historical memory and whitewashing for the preservation of systematic violence.
</br>
</br>
<b>3. Afro-Punk</b>
</br>
Examining black experiences in a historically white genre, Afro-Punk creates an exciting audio soundscape, juxtaposing witty and vulnerable interviews with energetic performances from Matt Davis of Ten Grand, Bad Brains, Mariko Jones, Moe Mitchell of Cipher, and Tamar-kali Brown, among others. In the deconstruction of black experiences in the punk rock scene, the film delves deeply into feelings of isolation, loneliness, affinity and power, exposing a greater conversation about people of color existing in white spaces.

</br>
 </br>
<b>4. The House I Live In (Available for purchase)</b>
</br>
The House I Live In is a documentary that critically and unapologetically reveals the U.S. policy on the War on Drugs. The film constructs a comprehensive understanding on the U.S. criminal justice system with voices from dealers, officers, inmates, and scholars, that exposes a shocking reality of human rights injustices. Building off of Michelle Alexander’s “The New Jim Crow”, The House I Live In is an essential documentation of this United States prison industrial complex.
</br>
</br>
<b>5. Black in Latin America</b>
</br>
Insightful and quick, Black in Latin America is a PBS “docuseries” that explores the African Diaspora in Latin America. Each episode features a different region of the Caribbean, Central, and South America, presenting honest footage of every-day life, all the while delving into difficult questions about how identity, colorism, and African culture manifest globally. In a region where blackness is negated and ignored, Black in Latin America captures culture to open dialogue about critical issues.</h3>
