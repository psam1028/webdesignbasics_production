                    <p>
                    	I am currently study at Parsons, strategic design and management major. I have always love textures about clothes and interior design. It has always been my favorite part of the design, but at the same time I am a thinker and like to find solution for people. I love to connect business with design together. When I think, I think very logically, but I also think in a creative way. These help me generate ideas that are practical but at the same time creative too. I want to make creative work efficient and also have an impact of what I do, and want to make other peopleâ€™s life easier and happier. This is the ultimately goal for my career.
