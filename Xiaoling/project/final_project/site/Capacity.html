The second art piece is a broken iPhone that all the apps are made with pictures that took which show how and when people use their phone. All the pictures were photoshoped to make the background black and white, which means when people are using their cellphone they are ignoring the surrounding.  All the pictures are also covered with wire which shows the feeling of being stuck in the cadge, but no one is trying to get out, which showing the how people think about the cellphone. People admit that cellphone is not good in someway, but no one is willing to change.  Moreover, the time is set to infinity, which means the endless call, text, social media that we have with the phone. </p>
