    		<img id="bulletpoint"src="http://i411.photobucket.com/albums/pp199/chenx552/icons_zpsborwckvr.png" border="0"/><p>Peopleâ€™s heads are facing down all the time these days, instead of looking straightforward. This video is a record of a person who is considered as one of the app generation. The water in the cup is metaphor for the brain. The more we use the phone, the more information we receive from the smartphone. Therefore our brain is overwhelmed by the massive information from all over the world. Every moment we are on the phone, we are getting disengage with the people and environment around us. So I urge people to please give our brain a moment to breath and to take break, and so as for ourselves. </p>
