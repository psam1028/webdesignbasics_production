A. “From the first moment we get going, I’m really, really quick...to  just make my clients excited about the job... show them other success I’ve had, to say, ‘Hey, look what this could be. Your restaurant could be this, this and this. Your brand, your record could feel this good in your hands, and they feel another record, and they say, ‘Yeah!’”
 
It’s also important for Aaron that his clients understand that he’s not there to dictate to them how the design process will go down, but to form a sense of collaboration:.
 
“I just get them excited to know that it’s not just me making the decisions. They are guiding me. I like the idea of like them being surprised by what I make them, and it’s not a battle. It’s not an adversarial relationship.”
