<h2>Q. Do you think design is important to culture?</h2>

A. “YES. When a family is emigrating, and they fill the paperwork out--that is graphic design. And if the designers can think that through and make that smarter--that’s where design helps real people. Someone getting their license plate. They fill out the paperwork; that’s graphic design. So I’m really interested in that kind of stuff. Yes, design is crucial because it can make the little things in our lives...better. ”

At the same time, Aaron understands that a lot of design can also be just for show, even though he puts the emphasis on function in design, but he’s still grateful to have the design career he has.

“...but a lot of it is cake decoration. And I understand that. I’m lucky to be a part of that, so I know my place, you know. I understand that we are really lucky to have these jobs, to get away with it, to do this work.”
