A. “It’s just sorta my “Tall Tales from a Large Man” lecture, but really it’s about getting away with a little life in design. Talking about some of the weird jobs I’ve had...coz, it’s not always about making the cash. Sometimes, the jobs that made me no money still feel the best.”

Aaron  points that sometimes working an unpaid job serves as a gateway to success.
 
“Interesting enough, some of those jobs I made no money off, become the things that people see, and I get hired for the real money.”
 
Although Aaron gained great success and recognition in his creative journey, he preserves a very modest and down to earth attitude that centers around the joy graphic design gives him.
 
“I’ve tricked graphic design into hiring me. That’s just weird… I’ve been able to get away with a great life...saving money...paying off my house...doing work for no money...doing work for big, big jobs...doing work for some movie stars...doing work for the president. I’m not supposed to be doing that kinda stuff, and if that never happened, I’d still be happy making design with my friends.”
Aaron enjoys doing his own thing, going against the grain, manifesting his own esthetic.
 
“Everyone’s polished, so I’ve been a little bit unpolished!”
