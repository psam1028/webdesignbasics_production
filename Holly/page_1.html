A. “I’m from the Midwest. As a youngster at 19 years old, got out of there after getting a tiny, little associate’s degree. Went out west with my buddies to be a snowboarder.” <br>Instead of going to college, Aaron and his buddies rode around the west<br>.
 
<br>“So for five years I did that--I lived like an animal. Was painting and drawing...going to Alaska to get my first computer. That was ‘96. Got my computer from washing dishes!”After Alaska, Aaron returned to Oregon to work for a couple of winters, and finally went back to school at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.<br>
 
<br>However, things didn't work out immediately after finishing school. He moved to LA for two unhappy years, until he found himself back in Oregon, once again.
“I’ve been in Oregon for 13 years; it’s been great! Making logos, posters, field notes...kinda whatever.”<br>
