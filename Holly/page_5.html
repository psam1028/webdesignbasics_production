A. “Goin junkin’ all over the nation, you know, functional things like a pair of blue jeans that are like 501s, just the simple ones. That to me is beautiful because it’s worked for 75 years or a 100 years. So those things that still work today--that’s impressive to me.”
 
Aaron’s also a huge fan of rummaging through what he calls “dead stuff” for his inspiration.
 
“But really I love going into like dead places, junk drawers and estate sales and antique malls and going junkin’ and finding dead stuff and making new life out of it. It might just be color, type, design, whatever, but I can find such great beauties in one afternoon of dead stuff. It’s really interesting to me.”
 
Creating a system to retain all this visual information and sources of inspiration is as important as finding the items that might inspire future work - -
 
“I kinda know how to look and then how to collect it. I make notes and draw. That’s how I was trained. So when I see something cool, I take a photo. I write down where I can find it.”
