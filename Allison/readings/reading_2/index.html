        <h3 id="heading">By Steve Johnson</h3>
        <p id="p1">1. Once the hypertext started appearing across coding "many of us thought the primary impact of hypertext would be on storytelling”, but little did we know, there would be so much more to hypertexts than just that. Rather than traditionally reading through a story, hyperlinks encouraged people to explore them.</p>
        <p id="p2">2. Steve Johnson decided to take this exploration upon himself through a magazine he created titled Feed. Feed was "dedicated to exploring the transformative potential of journalism in a hypertext world.”</p>
        <p id="p4">4. Unfortunately, due to the amount of blogs, social networks started to appear. There was now more than one author to these pieces on different sites. Feed was not successful at following this unpredictable trend.</p>
        <p id="p5">5. After reading this text, my question is: Why can’t Feed keep up with this new trend of blogs and social media instead? I think the article is very beautifully designed. The idea of going from one part to the next is an interesting way to perceive a traditional article. At first I read it in order because I didn’t get the idea of clicking through it, but once I did, I saw that there are many ways to take this article. Just like there are any ways to read a story. I decided to work from this style of layout and I made my own web page based off of it. I found that even though it makes for an interesting layout, the hierarchy is still confusing.</p>
        <p id="p3">3. Upon exploring hypertext, Johnson found that they "turned out to be a brilliant medium for bundling a collection of linear stories or arguments written by different people.”</p>
