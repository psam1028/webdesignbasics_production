        <h1>If it Doesn't Exist on the Internet, it Doesn't Exist.</h1>
        <h3>By Kenneth Goldsmith</h3>

        <h3>A Summary</h3>
        <p>The article If it doesn’t exist on the internet, it doesn’t exist begins with a simple statement. “If you don't exist on the internet, you don't exist.” Author Kenneth Goldsmith proves this to be correct through his explanation of making sure we are present psycially and virtually. This is done by putting up work online, and making sure we maintain that virtual presence for all to see.</p>
        <p>Make sure all work you put out into the world is in a digital form in addition to the physical, although, if you believe that you should keep things private, than the best route to go would be keeping things to paper. "I believe that books will merely act as a supplement to one's primary online experience.” Physical evidence is great to have, as long as it can be supported by what is online. It can be the first iteration of a project. The content online can be supported in a number of ways, far beyond print. There are more opportunities to access this content if it is on the web rather than just a book. This work is also more current than any kind of physical print.</p>
        <h3>My Take</h3>        
        <p>My question after reading this is, is there still a way to put youself out there whille still being private? As a design student, I completely agree with Goldsmith. Although I may start out the bulk of my projects on paper, untimately in some way they will end up on the internet. I am the kind of person that needs to put everything that represents me online because for what I want to do, I need that kind of exposure. I post my most curret work onto my Learning Portfolio and everyone has access to it. I believe that because I work this way, more people will take interest in what I do over designers that solely work in print(if there are any). I think using the virtual world to your advantage is a great way to create a strong branding of yourself, however others may feel differently. If you are not in a profession that requires platforms where people can look at your past work then it is ok to be private. After reading this, I feel that there is no way to maintain privacy, while also still being very public online. If you want to exist, then you need to expose who you are and make it accessible to everybody. </p>
