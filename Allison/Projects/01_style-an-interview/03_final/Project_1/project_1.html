<div id="content">
<span class="name"> TINA: </span> <p class="question">Describe your path to what you are doing now.</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>I went to the University of Oregon. I was really interested in photojournalism because I had always wanted to be a photographer. My grandfather was a photographer; that was his hobby that he did all the time. When I was growing up, I spent a lot of time with him in the darkroom, and I loved that process. Every time I take a photo, I can still hear him saying, “Hold that camera steady!” I will always remember his attention to precision and craft, which I loved. He was a huge creative influence on me.</p>

<p>The University of Oregon had a good photojournalism school, but I took two classes there and did not like it. I switched my focus to international studies, and art history.</p>

<p>I was the music director at KWVA in Eugene, Oregon. When I started working at the station, I was also making posters. Before that, I had always made zines because I was into music. I carried that through to the radio station, where I made t-shirts, posters, and zines.</p>

<p>My path has been littered with meeting awesome people at just the right time. I’m a huge English soccer fan. One day in college, I was sitting in the dorms, and I saw this kid wearing a Manchester United shirt—I was wearing one, too! It was 1994 and that was very unusual back then. We started talking; his name was Clint and he was really cool. I met a friend of his named Scott Nelson. Scott ran an ISP out of his parents’ garage, but he operated it from Oregon. He taught me how to write HTML. I remember typing my first line of code, and it said, “Hello, world. My name is Jon Setzen, and this is my website”.</p>

<p><strong>“Even though I liked to draw, I think the main part of creativity for me was imagination and make-believe…It was that kind of stuff from childhood that, in a weird way, gave me confidence to experiment and try new things.”</strong></p>
<p>Doing posters and zines while at the radio station had turned into making a website for the station. I really liked coding and design, but never thought about having a job doing it. After school, I returned to San Francisco to look for work. I had always wanted to work at a newspaper, and I got a job at The Jewish Bulletin of Northern California.</p>

<p>From there, I transitioned into working at the San Francisco Chronicle. The day I started there, the two other designers on staff left to create a startup. I was 23 and in charge of design for the interactive side. There was something about working for the newspaper. I loved the idea that thousands of people were going to look at my work and get something out of it every day. It was great being in that newsroom environment; I liked the fast pace.</p>

<p>While I was in San Francisco, I started doing a lot of freelance work on the side. I slowly realized I didn’t want to live there anymore. I thought about living in London where I have a lot of family—</p>

<p>My best friend was in New York. His girlfriend was going to be in Paris for school for the year and he told me I should come to New York.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">No way!</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>Yeah, crazy! I moved to New York a couple days before Thanksgiving in 2001. I told myself, “Oh, I’m such a good designer that I’ll just get a bunch of work.” Seven months later, I had almost no work, and I had started doing free work for nonprofits.</p>

<p>I was living in Brooklyn and would walk around and talk with nonprofits. I’d ask to redesign it all for free with credit for the work. I did that for three or four nonprofits and it really started to pick up, but then I got to the point where I didn’t have any money. I went onto Craigslist and took a job moving furniture in Queens. I was the worst furniture mover in the history of furniture movers. I hit that low point and didn’t know what I was going to do, so I convinced my landlord to let me make a website for him in exchange for three months of rent.</p>

<p>During all of that, I reconnected with Jennifer Fowler, a woman who I new from college radio. She was working at a company called J Records. Clive Davis had started J Records and their main artist was Alicia Keys. Jennifer needed someone to do banner ads and landing pages and splash sites for her. I said, “I’m your man!” I got that contract and had it for the next 11 years.</p>

<p>After all of that, things picked back up and I ran my own studio, Standard Motion, for 10 years. I had a space in DUMBO, which is how I met Tina.</p>

<p>I was doing good work for cool clients, and I started doing contract work for some larger agencies. About half of the work involved designing for photographers and photo agencies. I had also done work with Alicia Keys, which was my favorite; I spent almost a year with her in the studio, documenting the making of her second album.</p>

<p>Then I had a kid. I was tired of waiting to get paid by clients, and I had an opportunity to work with some folks who were creating a startup agency in LA. I started working for that agency and really loved them. I was finally ready to leave New York and have a full-time job, so my family and I moved out here to LA.</p>

<p>I loved the people I was working with, but after a while, I started to hate the hours. I also didn’t like working for marketing departments at big companies that didn’t care about their products—they only cared about themselves moving up the ladder. That was my perception anyway. Media Temple hit me up, and I’ve now been here for almost three years. I’m in charge of the creative here as well as UX.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">What a story! You mentioned Toronto and the Bay Area. Where did you grow up, and was creativity part of your childhood?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>I was actually born in Johannesburg, South Africa, but we left in 1977 when I was about two. We moved to Toronto, where I lived until I was nine. Then we moved the Bay Area, where my parents still are.</p>

<p>As far as creativity, I already mentioned my grandfather, who was great. My mom had done a lot of sculpture. My sister and I drew often as kids because we flew often. We’d go to South Africa with our parents or I’d go visit my grandparents in Vancouver for the summer. Now, my kids sit with iPads on the plane, but I didn’t have that. Instead, my mom had these cool craft books for us to do on the plane.</p>

<p>Even though I liked to draw, I think the main part of creativity for me was imagination and make-believe. I used to love wearing costumes, which my older son now does. I spent hours playing soccer in our driveway in Toronto, pretending I was playing for Manchester United in the FA Cup Final. It was that kind of stuff from childhood that, in a weird way, gave me confidence to experiment and try new things. While I was never a good artist, I think I have a lot of good ideas, which stems back to using my imagination.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Did you have an “Aha!” moment when you knew that design was something you were really interested in?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p><strong>It’s weird because I still feel like I don’t know what I truly want to do, but I do know what it feels like when I do something that I want to do</strong>, if that makes sense. <strong> I want to work for the joy of what the work is</strong>, which I feel like I’m doing now. When I left advertising, I never wanted to put myself in the position of having that kind of work stress again. I don’t have that stress at Media Temple; it’s not because the job isn’t hard. But I’ve shifted to doing design for service as opposed to design for selling stuff. I guess my “Aha!” moment was leaving advertising. Now, I want to do work that helps small businesses, like when I had my studio and did work for sole proprietors. I get to do that here at Media Temple. I design and create things that hopefully make the lives of our customers easier and better.</p>

<p>Learning how to do HTML was also a big “Aha!” moment for me because it was so fun, and it was so immediate.</p>

<p>Also, around 2002 or 2003, I understood the importance of delegation for the first time. I always want to be a designer, but I enjoy the delegation process and the collaborative aspect of things.<strong> You realize that maybe the way you’ve been doing things isn’t the only way to do them. </strong></p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Definitely. Have you had any mentors along the way?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>My friend, Tsilli, who I already mentioned, was definitely a mentor. When stuff would get bad at work or I was in a tough place, I’d call her. She was an amazing sounding board. When you’re self-employed and serving as designer and creative director, and only the client sees your work, you can get stuck in tunnel vision. <strong> It’s important to have another set of eyes. </strong> Tsilli is one of those people who gives me really critical feedback, doesn’t pull punches, and we can still be friends. I need that.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Yeah! Has there been a point when you’ve taken a big risk to move forward?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>Definitely. I had a really good job in San Francisco. I loved working at the newspaper and was making good money considering how young I was. To leave that and go to New York was a big risk, but <strong> I needed to do something to get out of my comfort zone and challenge myself </strong>.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I did in New York, like the door-to-door design salesman pitching, was a risk because I’m introverted. I’m getting better, though.</p>

<p>Oh, there’s one other chance encounter I should mention. When I was looking for work in New York, I used to DJ—not well. I met these guys named Mikey Palms and Matt Roff. They asked if I’d do some posters because they just booked a show with this band called Mogwai. Over the next few years, I ended up making 400 posters for them, and poster-making became a decent side business for a few years. Being able to sell design on my own terms was great.</p>

<p>Moving to LA was another risk, but it was easier because I had my family and a job.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">What was it like moving from New York to LA?<p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>New York is the best place I’ve ever lived. I miss it daily. I don’t necessarily miss living there daily, but I miss the feeling I had in New York, which you just don’t get anywhere else.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided I didn’t want to live in an apartment; I wanted a backyard, I wanted my kids to have a backyard, and I wanted some space. It was time. Maybe when I’m 60, my wife and I will move back to New York and live in an apartment with a doorman and an elevator, and we’ll send our dry cleaning out, and order food in.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Are your family and friends supportive of what you do?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>As far as mentors go, I’m lucky to have had parents who are supportive and who work so hard. We’re double immigrants; my parents left South Africa and started over with nothing in Toronto; then they left Toronto and started with nothing in California. Seeing them work so hard and make sacrifices for my sister and I has been incredibly influential.</p>

<p>I feel like a big part of my job now is to build teams and mentor others. I have the best team I’ve ever had anywhere here at Media Temple. I love watching them grow and become more confident. That’s super important to me.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Are you creatively satisfied?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>I am, but I’m constantly hungry. One of the reasons I wanted to be involved in CreativeMornings is because it talks about process. These days, so much of our experience with design is with platforms like Pinterest that only show the beautiful finished product laid out on a table with a coffee cup. I love when people talk about mistakes and the creative process.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">Anything you’d like to explore that you’re not doing now?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>I don’t know. I started a little candle company about two years ago.</p>

<p>I have always loved the smell of pipe tobacco. My grandpa didn’t smoke, but he would test the pipe tobacco, and I remember his studio having that smell when I was a kid. A couple years before he died, he told me what was in his recipe, and I took it in to a candle factory. Candle factories are crazy: you can bring them a branch and they’ll match it, and it’ll smell like your house when you were a kid.
</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">That’s so cool!</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>I told the candle factory, “It’s these four smells,” and they made me a set of jars for each of the scents. I opened up and smelled one of the little jars, and I literally started tearing up because it felt like I was seven years old again. That’s how I started the candle company. I enjoyed that process, but the fulfillment is tough because I do it all myself once a week. But I want to grow that line because scent and fragrance are quite interesting.</p>

<p>For the past year, I’ve been working on another side business: it’s an ice cream company called Smile Frozen Goods. My pal Kevin, one of the founders of Boxed Water, had an idea to do something with ice cream. We shot it around for a while, and we did our first pop-up shop last weekend. He’s been the brains behind everything; I’ve just been doing the design. It’s been super fun working on the branding, but I want to be more involved with him. We have a little cart right now, but I’m hoping that Smile Frozen Goods grows to the point where we can have a physical location.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">What advice would you give to someone starting out?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p><strong> Take chances, pick something you’re good at, and focus. </strong> When I look at my older websites from 2005 or earlier, I was a photographer, designer, illustrator, and videographer, but I wasn’t particularly great at any of them. I see that lack of focus a lot of times when I do portfolio reviews for younger people at art schools, public speaking engagements, or workshops.</p>

<p>I also believe that people need to have expectations. There is a strange outlook with this new generation—the millennials?—where there’s a sort of entitlement for success without having to work hard. I’ve had bad jobs and internships: folding t-shirts at radio stations, working in a stock room at Nordstrom, delivering pizzas, and all of that. It’s important to have those bad jobs so you understand when you actually find a good job.</p>

<p>And you still learn valuable skills through the bad jobs, too, like how to negotiate and interact with customers. <strong> It might not be your dream job, but you’re still learning x</strong>.</p>

<p>It motivates you. If you work at a bad job, it makes you think: “Ugh, I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. I need to focus on something and figure out what I do want to do.”</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">You’ve mentioned LA a lot. How does living there impact your work and creativity?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>Whenever I’m interviewed or asked to give talks about creativity and LA, I usually say that there is something about the light in LA that just doesn’t exist in other places. I wake up early, and there’s something about the early morning light here that is so conducive to doing something creative.</p>

<p>I’ve spent so much time working on digital or interactive work that all I want to do here is work on physical products. There is an authentic community of people who fabricate here. For example, with the ice cream company I’m working on with Kevin, everything is made by hand. There is a great amount of drive, craft, and authenticity about so much that is happening here.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has an extremely powerful entrepreneurial spirit. Everyone is doing various things.</p>

<span class="name"> TINA: </span><p class="question">What kind of legacy do you hope to leave?</p>
<span class="name"> JON: </span><p>That’s such a tough question. There are a couple things. I would like for someone who has worked for me to end up doing something amazing.</p>

<p>I’d like my kids or grandkids to be somewhere in the future—where bookstores still exist—and go into a store and find a book about design in the early 2000s with a page featuring my work. I’d hope that they’d buy that book, and that it would help them understand why I worked so much and how much I enjoyed what I did.</p>

<p>I would like to be remembered more for being a good person who helped others advance themselves as opposed to only being a guy who made things, but I am a guy who makes things. I hope there is some kind of legacy left by the work I’m doing, because it’s hard in the digital space: it all goes away.</p>
