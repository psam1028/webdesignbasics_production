    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <img src="img/me.jpg">
    <p>Hello, my name is Allison Pinz and I am a second year student at Parsons, the New School for Design. I am a Strategic Design and Management major and I will be minoring in Communication Design.</p>
    <p>My influence comes from my love of typography and simplistic design. I am a huge fan of Frank Stellaâ€™s line work. The simple yet intricate use of geometry he uses in his pieces also fascinates me. I also love the work of Aaron Koblin and Nicholas Felton who work more with numbers and statistics. They manage to contain their creative capabilities within charts and graphs and I find the so compelling.</p>
    <p>I have a huge interest in entrepreneurship and I hope to start my own company that integrates my love of design and technology in the near future. I hope to one day transform the world of business with my creative thinking and problem solving. I also love computer technology, graphic design, painting, photography and I have a newfound love in coding. I hope you enjoy my work!</p>
