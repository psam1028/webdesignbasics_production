    		<h3 class="header">What is The Photographer's Project?</h3>
    			<p class="p">The Photographers Project is an online resource for photographers, artists, and academics that provides high quality, open source images under the creative commons attribution share-alike 3.0 license. Images available on the site are from family archives and belong to the vein of family narrative.</p>
                <p class="p">Images are organized by type (snapshot, family photo, or document), as well as by the five elements of art. Each image is available for download at 300 dpi.</p> 
                <p class="p">The Photographer's Project can also be used as a resource to find other open source content imagery.</p>
			<h3 class="header">What is an attribution share-alike 3.0 license?</h3>
    			<p class="p">Under the creative commons attribution share-alike 3.0 users are free to share and adapt images for any purpose, including commercially. The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.</p>
				<p class="p">Terms</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Attribution</strong> — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.</li>
                        <li><strong>ShareAlike</strong> — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.</li>
                        <li><strong>No additional restrictions</strong> — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="p">You can read more about this license type and creative commons projects <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<h3 class="header">How can creative commons images be used?</h3>
    			<p class="p">Creative Commons offers a core suite of six copyright licenses. Because there is no single "Creative Commons license," it is important to identify which of the six licenses is being applied, which of the six licenses has been applied to material that you intend to use, and in both cases the specific version.</p>
                <p class="p">All creative commons licenses require that users provide attribution (BY) to the creator when the material is used and shared. The images on this site are ShareAlike (SA), which requires adaptations of the material be released under the same license.</p>
                <p class="p">This information has been adapted from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons FAQ page</a>.</p>
