Plenty of artists derive inspiration purely from relationships/love, yet here it was \"turn away from your diary page.\" I now have a newfound respect for Swift, so thank you, Melissa. Swift maintained her composure as a young woman, delivering a newsflash to a journalist mom struggling through an alternate parent reality: \"There's nothing you can say to turn a 12-year old girl away from herself.\"  I listened to this interview twice.  Melissa, you should be embarrassed.  The questions with the most depth came from your daughter. Taylor, you're a consummate professional.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":112},{"forum":"npr-music","parent":1664046872,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"npr-feb3ff8f461fc5f753a64c9d3de60fca","about":"","name":"Tinger T","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.4101430000000001,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/npr-feb3ff8f461fc5f753a64c9d3de60fca/","url":"","reputation":1.4101430000000001,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2012-09-06T18:52:07","id":"31738870","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/npr-feb3ff8f461fc5f753a64c9d3de60fca.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/3173/8870/avatar32.jpg?1404905577"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/npr-feb3ff8f461fc5f753a64c9d3de60fca.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/3173/8870/avatar92.jpg?1404905577","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/npr-feb3ff8f461fc5f753a64c9d3de60fca.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/3173/8870/avatar92.jpg?1404905577"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"\"Melissa was condescending to say the least.\"  Of course she was.  \nMs. Swift on the other hand is vivacious, fun loving, and looks at life with the glass half full.","createdAt":"2014-11-01T00:39:23","id":"1664079932","thread":"3173681054","depth":1,"numReports":0,"isDeletedByAuthor":false,"likes":37,"isEdited":false,"message":"\u003cp>\"Melissa was condescending to say the least.\"  Of course she was.  \u003cbr>Ms. Swift on the other hand is vivacious, fun loving, and looks at life with the glass half full.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":37},{"forum":"npr-music","parent":1664046872,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"paigegray","about":"","name":"Paige Gray","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"url":"","isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.3197729999999999,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/paigegray/","isPowerContributor":false,"reputation":1.3197729999999999,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2014-02-25T03:29:51","id":"96258906","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/paigegray.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9625/8906/avatar32.jpg?1444095977"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/paigegray.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9625/8906/avatar92.jpg?1444095977","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/paigegray.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/9625/8906/avatar92.jpg?1444095977"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"I do understand where you are coming from, but isn't also ageism to say that the concerns and interests of 12-year-olds are less valid or less sophisticated or less complex than those of adults?

<p>I was surprised that Melissa Block would begin her interview by saying that she consulted her 12-year-old daughter to prepare, and would then begin the conversation with two questions from a 12-year-old. I was more surprised that she so persistently focused on middle school children, that she could never give Ms. Swift credit for appealing to anyone over 12. She proceeded to bring up the vulnerability of middle-school girls and to ask her guest if she had ever thought about writing songs that, well, explored serious ideas. Ms. Swift remained remarkably congenial in the face of such condescension.</p>

<p>I think “condescension” is a little strong. I think Ms. Block understands that a large core of Swifts audience is composed of teenage girls and she wanted to know whether Swift had any interest in broadening her themes beyond typical, teenage love angst, bubble gum pop. There’s nothing wrong with songs like “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” and “Trouble”, and there’s nothing condescending about characterizing someone’s music accurately. The Beatles hit big early with songs like “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”; nothing condescending about characterizing that as bubble gum pop, and Lennon/McCartney grew to be some of the most accomplished songwriters in the history of music. Swift was very reasoned, and reasonable in her answer; indicated that she’s interested in broadening her themes and gave very thoughtful insight into some of the ideas that she finds important. The whole thing was a fair exchange.</p><p>If I’d criticize anything, it’s that Block missed an opportunity to get some insight into an incredibly successful young businesswoman’s experiences in the industry. That’s the type of inside dope any young person could use. And <i>that</i> Taylor Swift has to be at least as inspiring to young people as the musician.</p>

<p>Hey, nice to meet you, I'm one of the guys who flagged your post, down-voted it and hope it gets taken down. While it's worth discussing whether Swift's music is advancing music forward or spiraling towards a creative black hole, your use of Hitler as a blanket thing-I-don't-like term is completely apt, appropriate, proportionate, and representative of everything NPR stands for. Have a good day.</p>

<p>Taylor swift is so delusionally self-centered and controlling, even when she's simply talking to children about reading. Her entire umwelt is a lie about reality. She's not even good at fake politeness of humility. Her beliefs are her downfall, but I'm sure she was never that intellectual.</p><p>She brilliantly self-destructed the entire music business/industry with her blank track 3. It literally disproves her entire career and music as a marketing art, i.e. #1 all for nothing. The day the music really died.</p><p>I'm not even going to blast her about obsessive compulsion to bring up feminism every time. It's far too easy to deconstruct the pleasure of faking it...</p><p>Edit: This comment was originally deleted by Adolph "NPR" Hitler.</p>

<p>I really think Melissa Block had the best intentions with using questions from her daughter and Taylor Swift seemed very grateful that her fans even as young as 12 are connecting and understanding her music.  I found this was a great interview showing that Taylor Swift is growing up personally and musically.   I think this interview allowed Taylor Swift to  show her fans and none fans that  she does more than think about boys. I have seem so many interviews with Taylor Swift and this is one of the first interviews I felt was not making fun at her but instead giving her the platform to express a brief part of herself.</p>

<p>Actually, I thought that was a great way into the interview, bridging the past to present and getting representation from her newest base fans that are a higher impact. The fact that Melissa has the upper and lower age groups and can group them together in the conversation is good interviewing. I guess I take it as a 'given' that Taylor's own age group still listens to her and are continuing to follow her. I do see your point especially with your last 2 sentences. Although I didn't see them as condescending until i looked back. I didn't listen to the interview, only read it. I liked the interview style because it gives Taylor a chance to be reflective and have a past while recognizing the maturity over time.</p>

<p>Correction: Taylor writes her own songs about real life experiences. She is nearly 25 and in my opinion writes songs that a 25 year old would write. It just so happens young girls find these songs appealing perhaps because they can relate to her songs in different ways. She doesn't write for anyone. She's writes for herself. And whatever "sugary pop" is, that is not Taylor.</p>

<p>@haley – FYI – your post is not a “correction” to mine, it is a differing opinion.</p><p>Taylor’s lyrics and presentation (video and stage) are juvenile. That’s precisely why Melissa Block led with the information that she consulted her 12 year old child for “expert counsel.” Did you read the interview?</p><p>Moreover, Swift’s music is pap (A soft food - as for infants). She can transplant herself to NYC and declare herself “grown-up.”<br>However, her music displays a lack of maturity and depth that one would expect from an average 12 year old.</p>

<p>David, why do you write that Taylor Swift doesn't write her own songs? Do you know something that disproves her (and her periodic co-writers') claims that she does indeed write them? Please share that information, if you have it.</p>

<p>Let me inform that Taylor does in fact write her own songs. I don't know where you received your facts from, but I know for a fact that she writes ALL of her songs thanks to reading the song credits inside her album cover. She has been writing songs since she was a small child and is extremely talented at what she does.  Can you explain to us how the music industry really works? I'm very interested to know. A what's so bad about 12 year olds anyway? Don't they have a say in the types of music they listen too? You sir, have it all wrong. Taylor Swift is far from a "pop production." She's a writer. And you don't have your facts straight. </p>

<p>As a fan of Taylor Swift's music, I was disappointed to hear Melissa Block badger the 25-year-old to use her platform to, what, send[ing] a broader message to girls who would be really receptive to hearing about big ideas and the big world that's outside ... things that might turn girls away from themselves in a different way?"Newsflash Melissa! It is not an artists, athletes, movie star or pop icon's job to be a role model for your kid. I'm curious as to what Melissa would suggest Taylor to say, something like "stay in school," "don't use drugs," or "no sex before marriage?" You be the role model, Melissa, you send a broader message, you help turn your daughter away from herself in a different way. I feel sorry for anyone who has achieved fame or notoriety for having to constantly fend off requests from individuals wanting to use them to further their own agenda.</p>

<p>I do not care what her credentials, and or what she has accomplished in the past. She does not come off as a shining star that writes with purpose; but rather a person that perhaps had underlying reasons to write nonsense.  If her work is what you describe( I would never have thought that) ,and her true character is not demonstrated in this piece, and  perhaps she should correct it. The article frankly is substandard. Honestly, one of the thoughts that crossed my mind as I read it was she has parent issues,  and taking her insecurities out on TS, that is exactly  how the article comes across.</p>

<p>@Herman. Well said. I listened to the interview and had the same thoughts. MB is guilty of the same double standard that TS talks about in this interview. I doubt that MB would ask male stars or older musicians to change their art to accommodate her tween. She seems to abdicate her role as the primary influence in her daughter's life. As some other posters have noted, MB has an impressive resume and it's odd that she should use her platform to tell a 24 year-old that she wasn't doing enough to save her daughter from...what? from seeing an example of how talent, hard work, and business savvy can result in success? And if it's about the lyrics, then maybe MB should ask other artists that are no doubt in her daughter's playlist if they can stop singing about relationships, drugs, and sex and squeeze in some catchy hooks about abuse, income inequality or whatever other topics MB sees as more appropriate for her daughter. MB is a great journalist, but this interview was a misstep and an embarrassment.</p>

<p>The larger point here is that Taylor Swift would not sell 1 million units if she were writing lyrics of substance or acting her age. <br>Moroever, her lyrics, videos and "image" cater to the a section of society that would like to believe it has no care in the world - aside from boys and "feeling awkward." It appears that many parents love the message and purchase in turn.<br>In addition to the above, Taylor is everything that is wrong with the U.S. music industry and NPR should stop covering her immediately. It's bad enough that Sarah Palin STILL makes headlines!</p>

<p>Melissa was condescending to say the least. A perfect example of ageism.  Instead of approaching her guest as the music artist and professional that she is, she passive aggressively addressed Swift as her daughter.  I'm not really a fan of Taylor Swift's music, per se. But I felt Melissa was unprofessional, sexist and ageist.  Plenty of artists derive inspiration purely from relationships/love, yet here it was "turn away from your diary page." I now have a newfound respect for Swift, so thank you, Melissa. Swift maintained her composure as a young woman, delivering a newsflash to a journalist mom struggling through an alternate parent reality: "There's nothing you can say to turn a 12-year old girl away from herself."  I listened to this interview twice.  Melissa, you should be embarrassed.  The questions with the most depth came from your daughter. Taylor, you're a consummate professional.</p>
