Now my ears may have been playing a trick on me but I thought I heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote on quote about homos in the military. Was i right hearing that expression? </p>

				<p><img src="douche.png" width="50" align="left">Absolutely- putting homosexuals in the military </p>

				<p> <img src="bernieicon.jpg" width="50" align="left">You said something bout homos in the military. Was the gentleman referring to the many thousands and thousands of gay people who put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country?</p>

				<p><img src="douche.png" width="50" align="left">I’m talking—</p>

				<p> <img src="bernieicon.jpg" width="50" align="left"> Was that the group of people that the gentleman was referring to?</p>

				<p> <img src="douche.png" width="50" align="left">I’m talking about the military people in the military do not support—</p>

				<p> <img src="bernieicon.jpg" width="50" align="left"> That’s not what you are talking about, you use the word homos in the military, you have insulted thousands of men and women who will put heir lives</p>

				<p> <img src="douche.png" width="50" align="left">I’m talking about you and liberals like you</p>

				<p> <img src="bernieicon.jpg" width="50" align="left"> I would also say if my friend in support of this amendment, if my friend from Oregon was involved in the nuclear freeze moment I want to congratulate him. There are millions of americans who wonder about the wisdom of spending millions and millions of dollars building more and more of nuclear weapons at the same time as republicans are cutting back on medicare Medicaid and student loans. Furthermore i find it incomprehensible that in a time when the vast majority of the people in this country are terribly concerned about what’s going on in the environment terribly concerned about the environmental implications of nuclear energy. That the american people do not know what is in their waterways and that various military installations might be accepted from federal regulatory practices, so I very much report this amendment thank you mister chairman </p>
