    <p> Isabela Weeks was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota but spent much of her early life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is based in New York City. She is currently a student at Parsons the New School for Design and Eugene Lang the New School for Liberal Arts. She is majoring in bother Fine Arts and Psychology.     I am a fine artist, my main medium being in assorted paints. I enjoy studying people, their mannerisms and habits, good and bad. In all of my work, not just my paintings, my goal is to make people aware. I am fascinated with the human mind, often addressing in my work human emotion. This also comes from my background in psychology, which I am double majoring in along with fine arts. I am fascinated with color theory and artists such as Lucian Freud, color and contrast to a discomforting, almost grotesque degree, in order to examine the relationship between an artist and a model, and the psychology of humans. My mission is to create art that provokes feeling.</p>
