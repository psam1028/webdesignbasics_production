    <p> Isabela Weeks was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota but spent much of her early life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She is based in New York City. She is currently a student at Parsons the New School for Design and Eugene Lang the New School for Liberal Arts. She is majoring in bother Fine Arts and Psychology. She considers herself a fine artist, her main medium being in assorted paints. She enjoy studying people, their mannerisms and habits, good and bad. In all of her work, not just her paintings, her goal is to make people aware. She is fascinated with the human mind, often addressing in my work human emotion. This also comes from her background in psychology. She is fascinated with color theory and artists such as Lucian Freud, David Salle, Neo Rauch, and Frida Kahlo. She is interested in examining the relationship between an artist and a model, and the psychology of humans. She is intigued, by semiologies, and the idea of signs. She often experiments with different broadly stereotyped concepts, and trying to change their context. Her mission is to create art that provokes reflection and awareness.</p>
